# YouTube-Playlist-Link-Collector
Use script to collect the links in a YouTube playlist

Format to run (without "<" and ">"):

	python collect.py <link to playlist>

If you want the video titles and links (title above link format), run:

	python collect.py <link to playlist> --wt t	("wt" stands for "with title" & "t" for true)


Notes:
  - Script is made to run on shells like the windows command prompt, Git, linux shell, etc.
  - Make sure your playlist is set to public.

Anyways, hope this helps someone out there!
