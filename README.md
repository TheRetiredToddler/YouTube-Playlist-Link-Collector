# YouTube-Playlist-Link-Collector
Use script to collect the links in a YouTube playlist

Format to run (without "<" and ">") : python YouTubePlaylistCollector <link to playlist>

Notes:
  - Script is made to run on shells like the windows command prompt, Git, linux shell, etc.
  - Make sure your playlist is set to public.
  
Will probably be adding some more functions and improving my code where I can soon.

Anyways, hope this helps someone out there
